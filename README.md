# ZleepBed
This repository specifically contains the posture detection system, designed to run on an Arduino with three weight sensors that capture real-time sleep posture data for accurate monitoring and analysis.

ZleepBed was submitted to the AI Innovator Award 2023 and won 1st place. The project focuses on AI-driven sleep analysis, featuring posture detection and snoring detection. This system represents one of the two AI components we developed and is an integral part of the broader concept of a functional smart bed.
